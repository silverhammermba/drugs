    "Pediatric Dosing": "Not indicated",
    "Notes & Precautions": [
      "Prehospital use of oxytocin is limited to the control of postpartum hemorrhage. During hospital care it is sometimes used to initiate the labor process, however it should not be used in prehospital care prior to the delivery of either the child or the placenta.",
      "Be sure that another fetus is not expected to be delivered before oxytocin is administered.",
      "It should be used in conjunction with fundal massage for post-partum hemorrhage.",
      "Evaluate the fundus every 5 minutes during and after oxytocin administration.",
      "Naturally occurring oxytocin is secreted from the posterior pituitary gland as the mother breast-feeds the infant. This process may naturally contribute to the control of post-partum hemorrhage."
